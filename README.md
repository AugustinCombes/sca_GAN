##### GAN mimicking EHR health data to realize more ethical predictions on sudden cardiac arrest in Paris' area population

## Overview of the problem
The objective of this work is to mimick healthcare consumption of real sudden-cardiac-arrest patients from Paris and its suburbs. The data used was provided by the CEMS (sudden cardiac arrest expert center) at Georges Pompidou European Hospital, in collaboration with INSERM, AP-HP and the Paris-Cit√© University. 

This two-in-one work mimicks both tabular data (see medgan_tabular model) and sequential data (see medgan_sequential model) : while in both cases, the model will create synthetic patient data, the two models differ in the data format. 
- Tabular data refers to the count of occurence of every int-encoded ehr event available: for instance, when creating a synthetic patient with 100 possible EHR events, it will generate a vector in |N^100, that represents the healthcare consumption of the synthetic patient over 5 years.
- Sequential data refers to generating a series of week-wise events: in this case, when creating a synthetic patient with 100 possible EHR events, it will generate n_timestep vectors of week-restricted tabular data in |N^100, each of which represents the healthcare consumption of the synthetic patient during a particular week, over 5 years.

While the work was initially designed for healthcare, the models can actually inspire ideas for other applications, when it does not solve the problem outright.
